# PawCare Website

A complete, responsive dog-care website built with Tailwind CSS CDN and a simple multi-page structure: Home, About, Services, and Contact.

Project overview:
- Pages: index.html (Home), about.html (About), services.html (Dog Care Services), contact.html (Contact)
- Design system: friendly, approachable dog-care aesthetic with warm, comforting colors
- Typography: category-appropriate pairing (Poppins + Nunito) applied via Tailwind utility classes in this project
- Accessibility: semantic HTML sections, descriptive image alt text, responsive layout

How to run:
- Open the four HTML files directly in a browser. No backend required.
- All assets are placeholders using https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1757325331955-9ba8182dc44e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1OTQyNzU1OXww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080 markers to be swapped with real assets during deployment.

File list:
- index.html
- about.html
- services.html
- contact.html
- README.md

Notes:
- All navigation links point to the generated pages to ensure internal navigation works reliably.
- The design uses a single, cohesive nav and footer across pages for consistency.
- Background images are placeholders and should be replaced with category-appropriate assets during final deployment.
